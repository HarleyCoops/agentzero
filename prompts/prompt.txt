"Do you agree with this calculation


A portfolio manager wants to test if the average return to test if the average return of a portfolio is different from 13%. A sample of 20 monthly returns has a mean of 12% and a standard deviation of 2%.

a) State the null and alternative hypotheses.
b) Calculate the test statistic.
c) Determine the critical value and make a decision at a 5% significance level.
d) Calculate the p-value and interpret the result.

**Answer:**
a) \( H_0: \mu = 13\% \)
   \( H_A: \mu \neq 13\% \)

b) Test statistic:
\[ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{12\% - 13\%}{2\% / \sqrt{20}} = \frac{-1\%}{0.447\%} \approx -2.24 \]

c) Critical value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance level with 19 degrees of freedom:
\[ t_{0.025, 19} \approx 2.093 \]

Since \( -2.24 < -2.093 \), we reject the null hypothesis.

d) p-value:
Using a t-table or calculator, the p-value for \( t = -2.24 \) with 19 degrees of freedom is approximately 0.04. Since \( p < 0.05 \), we reject the null hypothesis. There is significant evidence to suggest that the average return is different from 13%."
